# CASE STUDY

## Business Problem Statement

The app serves the house rental industry. In big metropolitan cities, a lot of new young
professionals move in for work and they need a place to stay. Most of the rental property market
is controlled by brokers which cause a lot of hindrances to owners and tenants.
The app will allow tenants to search for available places on the basis of a locality and other
specifications.

## User Scenarios

The user is prompted to input their preferred locations of stay and their tentative
Date of shifting. They are furnished with multiple tabs of information outlining various aspects.
The user can then navigate to each tab to obtain detailed information. The components are
grouped into two classes as below:

## 1. Must-Haves

```
● After the preferred locations are entered, the available houses should be displayed on a
map or as a list depending on the preference of the user
● The user should be able to schedule a visit to the house for inspection via the app
● User can choose different parameters like size of house, rent, amenities to search for the
houses
```
## 2. Stretch Goals

```
● The user should be able to search and find directions between major attractions, stores,
hospitals and public transportation from the selected house.
● The user can have the functionality to rate a place after visiting it.
```
